## Cascade Deletes:

- **user_addresses**:
  - If a user is deleted, it's reasonable to delete their associated addresses as well. Therefore, `user_id` in `user_addresses` should have a cascading delete relationship with `id` in `users`.
- **user_payments**:
  - Similar to addresses, if a user is deleted, it's logical to delete their associated payment details. Therefore, `user_id` in `user_payments` should have a cascading delete relationship with `id` in `users`.
- **password_reset_tokens**:
  - When a user is deleted, any associated password reset tokens should also be deleted. Therefore, `user_id` in `password_reset_tokens` should have a cascading delete relationship with `id` in `users`.
- **user_roles**:
  - If a user is deleted, it's reasonable to delete their associated role assignments. Therefore, `user_id` in `user_roles` should have a cascading delete relationship with `id` in `users`.
- **shopping_sessions**:
  - If a user is deleted, their associated shopping sessions might also be deleted. However, this depends on business logic. If you want to retain shopping session data even after the user is deleted, you might not want to cascade delete here.
- **audit_logs**:
  - The cascading delete here depends on whether you want to retain audit logs after a user is deleted. If you want to keep the logs for historical purposes, you shouldn't use cascading delete.

## Cascade Updates:

- None of the relationships seem to require cascading updates based on the provided schema.

## Simple Deletes/Updates:

- **products**:
  - If a product category or discount is deleted or updated, you might not want to automatically delete or update the associated products. Instead, you might want to handle these changes manually.
- **order_items**:
  - If a product is deleted or updated, you might want to handle the changes to associated order items manually, depending on your business logic.
